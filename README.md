## Problem Statement
Solve N-Queen problem using:
* An iterative method, and
* A recursive method
For N = 8 and N = 9

## N-Queen Problem
The Queenâ€™s puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on a NXN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, the solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column or diagonal.

To find all possible solutions to this problem, a backtracking method is performed to calculate all possible solutions from all possible combinations. This method allows for every single solution to be found, although it is a very time-costing method. 


### a) PseudoCode for Recursive and Iterative Methods
*PseudoCode for both methods can be found in the file within repository: https://github.com/booklover98/nqueens/blob/master/nqueens_pseudocode.md

### b) Programs and Comments
 * i) Recursive : recusive_2.py
 * ii) Iterative : iterative_nqueens.py

### c) All Solutions for N=8 & N=9
*Can be found for both methods, both N values in the file within repository: https://github.com/booklover98/nqueens/blob/master/nqueens_solutions.pdf

### d) Running-Time Comparison

Method | Finding 1st Solution, N = 8 |Finding all solutions, N = 8 |Finding 1st Solution, N = 9 |Finding all solutions, N = 9 |
------------ |------------ |------------ |------------ |------------ |
*Iterative* | 2.976 ms | 43.715 ms | 1.1823 ms | 101.3936 ms|
*Recursivce* | 2.738 ms | 16.604 ms | 1.0993 ms | 89.4477 ms|

### e) Discussion on Reported Running Times
